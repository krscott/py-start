# Agent guide for py-start

Code from the original py-start template may be removed as the project evolves.

## Development environment

Use `nix develop` to enter the development shell. Its hooks create `.venv` if
missing, activate it, and install the project with development dependencies on
creation. Agents can run this themselves; no user restart is needed.

For noninteractive commands, use `nix develop -c <command>`, for example:

```sh
nix develop -c python -m pytest
```

Run Python tools with `python -m <tool>` so they use the active environment and
can find its installed packages.

## Dependencies

Declare dependencies before installing them:

1. Add runtime dependencies to `pyproject.toml` under `dependencies`, or
   development dependencies under `project.optional-dependencies.dev`.
2. Add corresponding Nix runtime packages to `default.nix`. Add development
   tools needed by the Nix environment to `flake.nix`.
3. Run `python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'` in the development shell to refresh
   the installation.

For libraries without type hints, add available stub packages to development
dependencies. If stubs are unavailable, use a mypy override scoped to the
affected module in `pyproject.toml`.

## Validation

| Check | Command |
|-------|---------|
| Pyright | `python -m pyright` |
| Mypy | `python -m mypy .` |
| Tests | `python -m pytest` |

Both type checkers must pass. Keep any necessary type-checking exceptions narrow
and explain why they are needed.

Use pytest fixtures for setup and teardown. Minimize mocks.

## Code style

- Use Python 3.10+ type hints, such as `list[str | None]`.
- Keep imports at the top of the file unless a local import is necessary.
- Prefer returning values over raising exceptions. Make failures actionable.
- Use `pathlib.Path` instead of `os.path`.
- Prefer composition over inheritance and keep data easy to inspect, test,
  and serialize.

## Design documentation

Keep `DESIGN.md` current with application requirements and architecture. It
should contain enough detail for an agent to reproduce the application.
